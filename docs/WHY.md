# The Why: AI Engagement Hub

## TL;DR
Equip people to thrive alongside intelligent machines. The Hub helps schools teach human capacities (creativity, empathy, judgment, collaboration, discernment, adaptability) while giving teachers practical controls and visibility over AI use. It's not about policing; it's about guided partnership with AI.

## Problem
- AI outperforms humans at many "hard" cognitive tasks → traditional "prove-you-know-it" schooling loses relevance.
- Teachers need guardrails and guidance to use AI ethically, without turning classrooms into surveillance zones.
- Students need structured practice collaborating with AI while developing uniquely human strengths.
- Communities (especially the marginalized) need education that restores belonging and dignity, not just productivity.

## Why Now
AI is rapidly normalizing in learning. Without an intentional framework, usage becomes chaotic (cheating, over-reliance, inequity) or forbidden (missed opportunity). The Hub operationalizes [New Human Education](https://www.newhumaneducation.com/)—human-centered, AI-partnered learning.

## Who It's For
- **Teachers:** set norms, assign AI-supported work, see process, assess growth in human capacities.
- **Students:** use AI transparently, reflect on choices, build real work products.
- **Admins/Parents:** clarity on policy, progress, and ethics without micromanaging.

## Success Looks Like
- More meaningful student work (originality + rationale + reflection).
- Fewer integrity incidents; more transparent process (prompts, drafts, citations).
- Teacher time saved on setup/review; clearer formative assessment of human capacities.
- Students report greater belonging and confidence using AI responsibly.

## Principles (use these to guide UX/feature choices)

### 1. Partnership > Policing
Coach behavior; avoid "gotcha" vibes.

### 2. Transparency by Design
Capture prompts, sources, and reasoning steps.

### 3. Human Capacity Growth
Every feature ladders to the six capacities.

### 4. Consent & Dignity
Privacy-aware (FERPA/COPPA friendly), opt-ins, plain-language disclosures.

### 5. Low Friction
One-click classroom setup; works with Google Classroom/Canvas; minimal teacher overhead.

### 6. Equity
Works on low-end devices; supports students with different needs/contexts.

## Capabilities (driven by the Why)

### Guided Workflows
Assignment templates that scaffold AI use toward a target capacity (e.g., "Critique and Improve," "Brainstorm → Narrow → Justify").

### Process Capture
Store prompts, model outputs, edits, sources, and student reflections as a sharable timeline.

### Capacity Rubrics
Inline rubrics for creativity/empathy/judgment/etc.; quick teacher feedback.

### Policy Layer
School-specific rules (allowed models, disclosure requirements, citation norms).

### Integrity & Attribution
Require source links/quotations; highlight AI-assisted sections; avoid unreliable "AI detectors."

### Analytics that Matter
Trends in capacity growth, reflection quality, and responsible-use patterns—not just usage time.

### Community & Care Hooks
Reflection prompts about impact, empathy, and inclusion to reinforce belonging.

## Non-Goals
- Not a content-police/detector tool.
- Not "AI does the assignment for you."
- Not a data-hungry surveillance platform.
