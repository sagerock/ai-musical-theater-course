-- DISABLE RLS ON ALL REMAINING TABLES - Comprehensive Fix
-- =============================================================================

-- The chat query is complex and joins multiple tables. Instead of fixing one
-- table at a time, let's disable RLS on all remaining tables that could be
-- causing issues with the chat query.

-- COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION: Disable RLS on all tables involved in chat queries

-- Disable RLS on chat_tags (junction table)
ALTER TABLE public.chat_tags DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on reflections (joined in chat query)
ALTER TABLE public.reflections DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on any other tables that might be involved
ALTER TABLE public.notes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.attachments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify all RLS statuses
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('chat_tags', 'reflections', 'notes', 'attachments', 'tags', 'chats')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- This should show rls_enabled = false for all these tables
