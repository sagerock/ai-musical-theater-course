# Feature Management Quick Start Guide

## For Instructors & Users

### How to Request a Feature
1. Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sagerock/ai-musical-theater-course/issues/new/choose)
2. Select "Feature Request" template
3. Fill out all sections, especially:
   - Problem you're trying to solve
   - Who it helps and how often
   - How it aligns with educational goals
4. Submit and wait for evaluation (usually within 2 days)

### Understanding Feature Status

üéØ **Core** - Always available, essential features
‚ö° **Standard** - Regular features that can be toggled
üß™ **Experimental** - Beta features you can opt into
üö´ **Deprecated** - Being removed, find alternatives

### Trying Experimental Features
1. Look for the üß™ beta badge
2. Click to opt-in and accept the terms
3. Provide feedback using the feedback buttons
4. Features expire after 3 months if not successful

## For Developers

### Adding a New Feature - Checklist

#### 1. Before You Start
- [ ] Feature request exists and is approved (score ‚â• 3.5)
- [ ] Assigned to correct category (core/feature/experimental)
- [ ] Time budget allocated (8 hrs for prototype)
- [ ] Success metrics defined

#### 2. Implementation
```javascript
// 1. Add feature flag in .env
REACT_APP_FEATURE_MY_FEATURE=false

// 2. Import feature flag utilities
import { isFeatureEnabled, FeatureGate } from '../config/featureFlags';

// 3. Implement with feature gate
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <FeatureGate category="EXPERIMENTAL" feature="MY_FEATURE">
      {/* Your feature here */}
    </FeatureGate>
  );
}

// 4. Place in correct directory
src/components/experimental/MyFeature.js  // If experimental
src/components/features/MyFeature.js      // If standard
src/components/core/MyFeature.js          // If core (rare)
```

#### 3. Required Documentation
- [ ] README in component folder
- [ ] JSDoc comments on main functions
- [ ] User-facing documentation if needed
- [ ] Migration guide if replacing something

#### 4. Before Beta Release
- [ ] Feature flag working
- [ ] Beta warning displayed
- [ ] Analytics tracking added
- [ ] Feedback mechanism included
- [ ] Tested on multiple browsers

#### 5. Monitoring
- [ ] Usage metrics tracked
- [ ] Error tracking enabled
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] User feedback collected

### Feature Lifecycle Commands

```bash
# Check feature status
npm run features:status

# Enable experimental feature locally
REACT_APP_FEATURE_MY_EXPERIMENT=true npm start

# Generate feature report
npm run features:report

# Clean up deprecated features (run monthly)
npm run features:cleanup
```

### Directory Structure
```
src/
  components/
    core/           # Stable, essential (rarely changes)
    features/       # Standard features (production-ready)
    experimental/   # Beta features (max 3, auto-expire)
    deprecated/     # Being removed (max 3 months)

  config/
    featureFlags.js # Feature flag configuration

docs/
  FEATURE_REQUESTS.md   # Active request tracking
  FEATURE_LIFECYCLE.md  # Detailed lifecycle process
  WHY.md               # Mission alignment reference
```

### Quick Decision Tree

```
Is the feature essential for basic operation?
  ‚Üì NO                           ‚Üì YES
  ‚Üì                              ‚Üí core/
  ‚Üì
Will > 50% of users use it regularly?
  ‚Üì NO                           ‚Üì YES
  ‚Üì                              ‚Üí features/
  ‚Üì
Is this tested/experimental?
  ‚Üì YES                          ‚Üì NO
  ‚Üí experimental/                ‚Üí Don't build
```

## Key Metrics

### Success Thresholds
- **Prototype ‚Üí Beta**: Technically feasible
- **Beta ‚Üí Production**: >20% adoption in test group
- **Stay in Production**: >10% overall usage
- **Time Limit**: 3 months for experimental features

### Red Flags üö©
- Feature unused for 30+ days
- Support tickets > 5/month
- Performance impact > 200ms
- Error rate > 1%
- Negative feedback > 30%

## Monthly Review Tasks

**First Monday of Each Month:**

1. **Review Experimental Features**
   ```javascript
   // Check each experimental feature
   if (daysSinceCreation > 90 || adoptionRate < 0.2) {
     moveToDeprecated(feature);
   } else if (adoptionRate > 0.2 && stableFor(14)) {
     moveToProduction(feature);
   }
   ```

2. **Clean Deprecated Features**
   ```javascript
   // Remove features deprecated > 3 months
   deprecatedFeatures
     .filter(f => f.deprecatedDate < threeMonthsAgo)
     .forEach(f => deleteFeature(f));
   ```

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update FEATURE_REQUESTS.md
   - Archive completed features
   - Review new requests

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Instructor Requests Feature
1. They submit via GitHub template
2. Team evaluates within 2 days
3. If approved, prototype in experimental/
4. Test with that instructor's course
5. If successful, roll out wider

### Scenario 2: Feature Not Being Used
1. Monthly review shows < 10% usage
2. Add deprecation warning
3. Email affected users
4. Provide migration path
5. Remove after 3 months

### Scenario 3: Experimental Feature Succeeds
1. Metrics show > 20% adoption
2. Positive feedback received
3. Move to features/ directory
4. Remove experimental warnings
5. Add to documentation

### Scenario 4: Emergency Feature Removal
1. Security/performance issue found
2. Disable via feature flag immediately
3. Add to deprecated/ with explanation
4. Fast-track removal (1 week)
5. Notify all affected users

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO
- Start small with prototypes
- Use feature flags from day one
- Track metrics immediately
- Get user feedback early
- Plan for removal before building
- Keep features independent
- Document everything

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Build without approval
- Skip the evaluation matrix
- Keep unused features
- Add dependencies between experimental features
- Ignore user feedback
- Exceed time budgets
- Forget about mobile users

## Support & Resources

- **Questions**: Post in GitHub Discussions
- **Bug Reports**: GitHub Issues with `bug` label
- **Feature Requests**: Use the template
- **Documentation**: See `/docs` folder
- **Emergency**: Contact admin team
