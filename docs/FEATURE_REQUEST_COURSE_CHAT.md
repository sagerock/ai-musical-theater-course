# Feature Request: Course Chat Room

## GitHub Issue Template (Copy & Paste Ready)

**Title:** `[FEATURE] Real-Time Course Chat Room for Student/Instructor Communication`

**Body:**
```markdown
## ðŸ“‹ Feature Request

### Problem Statement
Currently, course participants have no way to communicate with each other in real-time within the platform. Students can't ask quick questions to peers, instructors can't make announcements to the whole class, and there's no informal communication channel. This forces users to rely on external tools (email, Discord, WhatsApp) which fragments the learning experience and reduces engagement within the platform.

### User Story
As a student, I want to chat with my classmates and instructor in real-time so that I can ask quick questions, get immediate help, and feel connected to my learning community.

As an instructor, I want to send announcements and answer questions in a central chat so that I can efficiently communicate with all students at once.

### Proposed Solution
Add a simple, Zoom-like text chat feature for each course:

**Core Features:**
- Real-time text messaging within each course
- Persistent chat history (saved for the course duration)
- Simple @mentions for directing messages
- "Who's online" indicator
- Typing indicators
- Message timestamps
- Basic text formatting (bold, italic, links)

**UI Design:**
- Collapsible chat panel (similar to Zoom's chat)
- Can be minimized/expanded while working
- Notification badge for unread messages
- Sound notification option (can be muted)
- Mobile-responsive design

**Access Control:**
- Only course members can see/participate
- Instructors can delete inappropriate messages
- Optional: "Announcement" messages that pin to top
- Chat history visible from enrollment date forward

### Affected Users
- [x] Students
- [x] Instructors
- [ ] School Administrators
- [ ] System Administrators

**Estimated number of users affected:** All active users (500+)
**Frequency of use:** Daily during active courses

### Success Metrics
- [x] Adoption rate > 60% (most courses use chat feature)
- [x] Reduces email volume between students/instructors by 30%
- [x] Increases daily platform engagement by 25%
- [x] Student satisfaction with communication improves
- [x] Average response time to questions decreases

### Alignment with Mission
- [x] **Empathy** - Builds community and peer connections
- [x] **Collaboration** - Enables real-time peer learning and support
- [x] **Adaptability** - Quick problem-solving through instant communication
- [x] **Judgment** - Students learn from seeing others' questions

### Technical Considerations
**Implementation Options:**
1. **Firebase Realtime Database** (Recommended)
   - Already in Firebase ecosystem
   - Real-time sync built-in
   - Cost-effective for text chat
   - Simple to implement

2. **WebSocket Server**
   - More control but requires infrastructure
   - Better for high-volume chat

3. **Third-party Integration** (Twilio, Stream.io)
   - Fastest to implement
   - Monthly cost per user
   - Less customization

**Technical Requirements:**
- Real-time message delivery (< 1 second)
- Message persistence (store in Firestore)
- Scalable to 50+ concurrent users per course
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Minimal performance impact on main app

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Forum/Discussion Board** - Too slow, not real-time
2. **Video Chat** - Too heavy, privacy concerns, not always needed
3. **External Tool Integration** (Slack/Discord) - Requires separate accounts, fragments experience
4. **Email Integration** - Not real-time, clutters inbox

### Priority
- [x] ðŸŸ¡ Important - Significantly improves user experience and engagement

### Additional Context
This is a frequently requested feature from multiple instructors. Many courses are currently using WhatsApp groups or Discord servers as a workaround, which means:
- Platform engagement is reduced
- Conversations are lost/not archived with course
- Students need multiple tools
- No oversight for inappropriate content

Similar successful implementations:
- Zoom Chat (simple, effective)
- Google Classroom Stream (basic but functional)
- Canvas Conversations (integrated messaging)

### Mock-up Description
