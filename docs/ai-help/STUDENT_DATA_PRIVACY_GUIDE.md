## What This Means for You

AI Engagement Hub takes your privacy seriously. This guide explains how we protect your data and what you can expect.

## For Students

### Your Privacy Rights

**What's Private to You:**
- ✅ **Your AI Conversations** - Only you and your instructor can see them
- ✅ **Your Projects** - Other students cannot access your work
- ✅ **Your Documents** - PDFs and files you upload are protected
- ✅ **Your Reflections** - Personal thoughts remain private

**What Your Instructor Can See:**

- Basic information (name, email)

**What Other Students CANNOT See:**

### Privacy Tips
1. **Be Yourself** - Your AI conversations are private from other students
2. **Ask Questions** - Don't worry about looking silly, only your instructor sees
3. **Learn Freely** - Experiment with AI without peer judgment
4. **Document Everything** - Your work is protected and timestamped

## For Instructors

### What You Can Access

**Within Your Courses:**
- ✅ All student AI interactions
- ✅ Uploaded documents and PDFs
- ✅ Student projects and work
- ✅ Analytics and usage patterns

**Privacy Boundaries:**
- ❌ Cannot see students from other courses
- ❌ Cannot access other instructors' course data
- ❌ Cannot view student data after they leave your course

### Best Practices
1. **Inform Students** - Let them know you can see their AI usage
2. **Guide, Don't Judge** - Use visibility to help, not penalize
3. **Respect Privacy** - Don't share student AI conversations
4. **Model Good Behavior** - Show appropriate AI usage

## For Parents & Administrators

### Our Privacy Commitment

**Data Protection:**
- FERPA compliant design
- No data mining or selling

- Educational use only

**Technical Security:**
- Database-level protection (Row Level Security)
- Encrypted data transmission
- Secure cloud storage
- Complete audit trails

**Student Safety:**
- Age-appropriate access controls
- No student-to-student messaging
- Instructor oversight built-in
- Clear data boundaries

## How Privacy Works

### The Technology Behind It

We use **Row Level Security (RLS)** - think of it as a smart filter that automatically shows each person only the data they're allowed to see:

```
Student A logs in → Sees only Student A's data
Instructor logs in → Sees only their course students' data
Student B logs in → Sees only Student B's data
```

This happens automatically at the database level, making it nearly impossible to accidentally expose private data.

### Real Examples

**Scenario 1: Group Project**
- Students work on separate AI conversations
- Each student sees only their own work
- Instructor sees all student work
- Privacy maintained while enabling collaboration

**Scenario 2: Peer Review**
- Student Assistants can view (not edit) peer work
- Original student maintains ownership
- Instructor oversees the process
- Clear audit trail of who viewed what
