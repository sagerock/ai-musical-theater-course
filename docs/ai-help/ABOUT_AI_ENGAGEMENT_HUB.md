# About AI Engagement Hub

## What is AI Engagement Hub?

AI Engagement Hub is an educational analytics platform that transforms how teachers and students interact with artificial intelligence in the classroom. Built in Summer 2025 by Sage Lewis using Claude Code, this platform provides real-time visibility into AI usage patterns, helping educators guide students toward effective and ethical AI use.

Think of it as a "learning management system for the AI age" - a place where:
- **Students** can safely explore AI tools with guidance
- **Teachers** can monitor and mentor AI usage
- **Learning** is enhanced, not replaced, by AI

## Why AI Engagement Hub?

### The Challenge

As AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini become ubiquitous, educators face new challenges:
- How do students actually use AI for learning?
- Are they using it to understand or to avoid thinking?
- Which AI tools work best for different subjects?
- How can we teach responsible AI use?

Traditional learning platforms weren't designed for the AI era. Teachers are flying blind while students navigate powerful tools without guidance.

### The Solution

AI Engagement Hub bridges this gap by providing:
- **Transparency** - See how students interact with AI
- **Guidance** - Direct students to appropriate AI tools
- **Analytics** - Understand usage patterns and effectiveness
- **Community** - Enable peer learning and support
