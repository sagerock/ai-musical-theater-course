## Common Questions

### Can someone have different roles in different courses?
Yes! A user can be a Student in one course, a Teaching Assistant in another, and an Instructor in a third. Course-specific roles override global roles within that course context.

### What happens when someone has multiple roles?
The highest role takes precedence. For example, if someone is globally an Instructor but enrolled as a Student in a specific course, they'll have Student permissions in that course.

### Can Student Assistants grade or evaluate work?
No, Student Assistants have read-only access to peer work. They can help and guide but cannot modify or formally evaluate.

### How do I request a role change?
Students should contact their instructor. For School Administrator roles, contact your institution's Global Administrator.

### Can roles be temporary?
Currently, roles persist until manually changed. Instructors should review and update roles each semester as needed.

## Troubleshooting
