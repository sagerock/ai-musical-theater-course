## Understanding AI as a Learning Tool

### The Learning Partnership Model

Teach students to view AI as a:
- **Learning Partner**: Not a homework machine
- **Thought Challenger**: Questions assumptions
- **Idea Generator**: Sparks creativity
- **Feedback Provider**: Offers perspectives
- **Skill Builder**: Develops critical thinking

### Setting Proper Expectations

Help students understand AI:
- **Strengths**: Pattern recognition, synthesis, explanation
- **Limitations**: Can hallucinate, lacks real understanding
- **Best Uses**: Brainstorming, explaining concepts, practice
- **Poor Uses**: Replacing thinking, avoiding learning

## Choosing the Right AI Model

### Model Selection Guide for Students

| Task | Recommended Model | Why |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| **Quick explanations** | GPT-4.1 Mini | Fast, cost-effective |
| **Complex coding** | GPT-4.1 | Superior reasoning |
| **Research & writing** | Claude Opus 4 | Best analysis, coherent writing |

| **Current events** | Sonar Pro | Real-time information |
| **Creative writing** | Claude Sonnet 4 | Balanced creativity |
| **Quick searches** | Gemini Flash | Fast responses |

### Teaching Model Awareness

**Cost Consciousness Exercise**:
```
Have students track:
1. Which model they used
2. Token count for each query
3. Estimated cost
4. Value received

Goal: Develop intuition for model selection
```

### Model Comparison Activity

Create assignments that require students to:
1. Ask the same question to 3 different models
2. Compare responses for:
   - Accuracy
   - Depth
   - Writing style
   - Usefulness
3. Reflect on which model was best and why

## Crafting Effective Prompts

### The CLEAR Framework

Teach students to write prompts that are:

**C**ontext-rich
**L**earning-focused
**E**xplicit in requirements
**A**ppropriately scoped
**R**eflective in nature

### Prompt Evolution Exercise

**Level 1 - Basic**:
```
"Explain photosynthesis"
```

**Level 2 - Improved**:
```
"Explain photosynthesis to a 10th grade biology student, 
focusing on the light and dark reactions"
```

**Level 3 - Effective**:
```
"I'm a 10th grade biology student learning about photosynthesis. 
Can you explain the light-dependent and light-independent reactions, 
including where they occur and their main products? Please use 
analogies that relate to everyday experiences."
```

**Level 4 - Master**:
```
"I'm studying photosynthesis for my 10th grade biology class. 
I understand that plants convert sunlight to energy, but I'm 
confused about the specific steps. Can you:
1. Explain the light and dark reactions separately
2. Use a factory analogy to show how they connect
3. Highlight 3 key molecules I should remember
4. Give me a practice question to test my understanding"
```

### Prompt Templates by Purpose

**For Understanding Concepts**:
```
"I'm learning about [TOPIC] in my [COURSE] class. I understand 
[WHAT I KNOW] but I'm confused about [SPECIFIC CONFUSION]. Can 
you explain [SPECIFIC ASPECT] using [PREFERRED LEARNING STYLE]?"
```

**For Problem-Solving**:
```
"I'm working on [PROBLEM TYPE] in [SUBJECT]. Here's what I've 
tried: [MY ATTEMPT]. I'm stuck at [SPECIFIC POINT]. Can you 
guide me through the next step without giving the full answer?"
```

**For Writing Assistance**:
```
"I'm writing a [TYPE OF WRITING] about [TOPIC] for [COURSE]. 
My thesis is [THESIS]. Can you help me [SPECIFIC NEED: outline, 
strengthen argument, find evidence, improve transitions]?"
```

## Common Student Mistakes

### 1. The Copy-Paste Trap

**What Students Do**: Copy AI responses directly
**Why It's Wrong**: No learning occurs, plagiarism risk
**Better Approach**: Use AI output as starting point for own work

**Teaching Activity**: 
Have students:
1. Get an AI response
2. Rewrite it entirely in their voice
3. Add personal examples
4. Cite AI as a brainstorming tool

### 2. The Homework Machine Mindset

**What Students Do**: "Do my homework for me"
**Why It's Wrong**: Avoids learning, develops dependence
**Better Approach**: "Help me understand so I can do it"

**Intervention Strategy**:
- Review student prompts
- Flag "do this for me" language
- Redirect to learning-focused prompts

### 3. The Single Source Error

**What Students Do**: Accept first AI answer as truth
**Why It's Wrong**: AI can be incorrect or biased
**Better Approach**: Verify, cross-reference, think critically

**Critical Thinking Exercise**:
1. Get AI response on controversial topic
2. Identify potential biases
3. Find contradicting sources
4. Form independent conclusion

### 4. The Shallow Interaction

**What Students Do**: One question and done
**Why It's Wrong**: Misses deeper understanding
**Better Approach**: Follow-up questions, dig deeper

**Depth Development**:
Teach the "5 Whys" with AI:
1. Initial question
2. Why is that?
3. Why does that matter?
4. Why should I care?
5. Why will this help me?

## Best Practices by Subject

### Mathematics
- Use AI to check understanding, not answers
- Ask for step-by-step explanations
- Request different solution methods
- Generate practice problems

**Good Prompt**: "I solved this calculus problem and got X. Can you work through it step-by-step so I can check my method?"

### Writing & Literature
- Brainstorm ideas and outlines
- Analyze themes and symbolism
- Get feedback on thesis statements
- Never use AI-generated text directly

**Good Prompt**: "My thesis for my essay on Hamlet is X. What are potential counterarguments I should address?"

### Science
- Clarify complex concepts
- Visualize processes with descriptions
- Connect theory to real-world applications
- Design hypothetical experiments

**Good Prompt**: "How would I design an experiment to test the effect of pH on enzyme activity? What variables should I control?"

### History
- Explore multiple perspectives
- Understand cause and effect
- Make connections between events
- Challenge historical narratives

**Good Prompt**: "What were different perspectives on the Industrial Revolution from workers, factory owners, and government officials?"

### Programming
- Debug with understanding
- Learn best practices
- Explore alternative approaches
- Understand error messages

**Good Prompt**: "My Python code throws this error: [ERROR]. Can you explain what's causing it and guide me to fix it myself?"

## Academic Integrity Guidelines

### Clear Boundaries

**✅ Acceptable Uses**:
- Brainstorming and ideation
- Concept clarification
- Grammar and style checking
- Research starting points
- Practice problem generation

**❌ Unacceptable Uses**:
- Submitting AI-generated work
- Having AI write assignments
- Using AI during closed-book exams
- Copying without attribution
- Avoiding assigned readings

### Citation Guidelines

Teach students to cite AI use:

**Format**:
```
I used [AI Model] on [Date] to [Specific Purpose]. 
The AI helped me [Specific Contribution] but all 
written work and analysis is my own.
```

**Example**:
```
I used GPT-4.1 on January 15, 2025 to brainstorm 
thesis statements for my essay on climate change. 
The AI suggested exploring economic impacts, which 
I independently researched and developed into my 
own argument.
```

### Creating an AI Honor Code

Sample classroom policy:
```
I pledge to:
1. Use AI as a learning tool, not a replacement for thinking
2. Always cite when AI influenced my work
3. Never submit AI-generated text as my own
4. Verify AI information with credible sources
5. Use AI to enhance, not bypass, my learning
```
