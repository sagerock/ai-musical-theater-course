## Core Principles

### Design for Learning, Not Avoidance

**Traditional Mindset**: "How do I prevent AI use?"
**AI-Enhanced Mindset**: "How do I leverage AI for deeper learning?"

### The SPARK Framework for AI Assignments

**S**ynthesis-focused - Require combining multiple sources
**P**rocess-oriented - Value the journey, not just outcome  
**A**I-transparent - Explicitly allow and guide AI use
**R**eflection-heavy - Build in metacognition
**K**nowledge-building - Create something new

## Assignment Types That Work

### 1. AI Collaboration Projects

**Example**: Research Paper with AI Process Documentation

Students must:
- Use AI for brainstorming (document prompts)
- Research with traditional sources
- Use AI to challenge their thesis
- Document how AI shaped their thinking
- Submit both paper and AI interaction log

**Learning Outcome**: Critical evaluation of AI suggestions

### 2. Comparative Analysis Assignments

**Example**: Multi-Model Literature Analysis

Students must:
- Ask 3 different AI models about a text
- Compare their interpretations
- Identify biases and limitations
- Form independent conclusion
- Present findings with evidence

**Learning Outcome**: Understanding AI perspectives and limitations

### 3. AI-Enhanced Problem Solving

**Example**: Coding Project with AI Pair Programming

Students must:
- Plan solution without AI
- Implement with AI assistance
- Document what AI suggested
- Explain every line of code
- Reflect on AI's impact on learning

**Learning Outcome**: Using AI as learning tool, not crutch

### 4. Creative Synthesis Projects

**Example**: Historical Event from Multiple Perspectives

Students must:
- Use AI to explore different viewpoints
- Verify AI claims with primary sources
- Create original narrative combining insights
- Cite both AI and traditional sources
- Present unique interpretation

**Learning Outcome**: AI as research assistant, not author

### 5. Process Portfolio Assignments

**Example**: Math Problem-Solving Journey

Students must:
- Show initial attempt
- Document AI consultation
- Explain AI's suggestions
- Show revised approach
- Reflect on learning process

**Learning Outcome**: Transparent learning process

## Assignment Types to Avoid

### ❌ Traditional Essays Without Process
- Easy to generate with AI
- No learning verification
- Encourages copy-paste

### ❌ Fact-Based Quizzes
- AI excels at recall
- Doesn't test understanding
- No critical thinking required

### ❌ Standard Code Functions
- AI writes these easily
- No problem-solving needed
- Bypasses learning objectives

### ❌ Summary Assignments
- AI summarizes perfectly
- No original thought required
- Minimal student engagement

## Sample Assignment Templates

### Template 1: AI Dialog Assignment

**Assignment**: Philosophical Debate with AI

**Instructions**:
1. Choose an ethical dilemma
2. Engage 3 AI models in debate
3. Challenge each model's position
4. Document the conversation
5. Write reflection on whose arguments were strongest

**Deliverables**:
- AI conversation transcripts
- 2-page critical analysis
- Personal position paper
- Process reflection

**Grading**:
- Quality of challenges: 30%
- Critical analysis: 30%
- Original position: 30%
- Process reflection: 10%

### Template 2: AI-Assisted Research Project

**Assignment**: Scientific Investigation

**Phase 1 - Hypothesis** (No AI):
- Develop original research question
- Form initial hypothesis
- Create methodology outline

**Phase 2 - Research** (With AI):
- Use AI to find related studies
- Verify AI suggestions
- Document search process
- Build literature review

**Phase 3 - Analysis** (Mixed):
- Analyze findings yourself
- Use AI to check logic
- Challenge AI's interpretations
- Develop conclusions

**Deliverables**:
- Research proposal
- AI interaction log
- Annotated bibliography
- Final paper with methodology

### Template 3: Creative Problem-Solving

**Assignment**: Design Challenge

**The Problem**: 
Design solution for campus sustainability issue

**Process**:
1. **Identify** (Human): Define specific problem
2. **Ideate** (AI-Assisted): Brainstorm with AI
3. **Evaluate** (Human): Assess AI suggestions
4. **Develop** (Mixed): Refine best ideas
5. **Validate** (Human): Test feasibility
6. **Present** (Human): Pitch solution

**Requirements**:
- Show all AI interactions
- Explain selection criteria
- Demonstrate feasibility
- Original implementation plan

## Assessment Strategies

### 1. Process-Based Grading

Instead of grading only final product:
- 20% Initial human work
- 20% AI interaction quality
- 20% Critical evaluation
- 20% Synthesis/originality
- 20% Final product

### 2. Oral Defense Component

Add verbal component to verify understanding:
- 5-minute presentation
- Q&A about process
- Explain AI contributions
- Defend conclusions

### 3. Reflection Requirements

Mandatory reflection addressing:
- What did you learn?
- How did AI help/hinder?
- What would you do differently?
- What questions remain?

### 4. Peer Review Integration

Students review each other's:
- AI interaction strategies
- Critical thinking process
- Original contributions
- Learning outcomes

## Rubric Examples

### AI-Enhanced Essay Rubric

| Criteria | Excellent (A) | Good (B) | Needs Work (C) | Poor (D/F) |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **AI Transparency** | Full documentation of AI use, clear attribution | Most AI use documented | Some AI use hidden | No AI documentation |
| **Critical Thinking** | Challenges AI, original insights | Some critical evaluation | Accepts AI uncritically | Pure AI copying |
| **Synthesis** | Seamless blend of sources | Good integration | Choppy integration | No synthesis |
| **Process** | Clear learning journey | Decent process shown | Minimal process | No process visible |
| **Original Voice** | Strong personal perspective | Some originality | Little personality | No original thought |

### AI Problem-Solving Rubric

| Component | 4 Points | 3 Points | 2 Points | 1 Point |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Initial Attempt** | Shows deep engagement | Good effort | Minimal try | No attempt |
| **AI Interaction** | Strategic, thoughtful | Decent prompting | Basic questions | Poor use |
| **Understanding** | Can explain all aspects | Explains most | Some gaps | Can't explain |
| **Implementation** | Working, elegant solution | Works with issues | Partially works | Doesn't work |
| **Reflection** | Deep insights | Good thoughts | Surface level | Missing |

## Implementation Tips

### Start Small
- Try one AI-enhanced assignment
- Gather student feedback
- Iterate based on results
- Scale successful approaches

### Be Transparent
- Share rubrics upfront
- Explain AI policies clearly
- Model good AI use
- Celebrate creative approaches

### Focus on Learning
- Emphasize process over product
- Reward critical thinking
- Value originality
- Build AI literacy

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-restriction**: Don't ban AI entirely
2. **Under-guidance**: Provide clear frameworks
3. **Punishment focus**: Reward good use instead
4. **Tech-only focus**: Remember learning goals
5. **One-size-fits-all**: Adapt to your subject
