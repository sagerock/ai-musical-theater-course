# Feature Components

## Purpose
Standard features that enhance the platform but aren't essential for basic operation. These components:
- Can be toggled via feature flags
- Improve user experience
- Add value for specific user groups
- Are stable and production-ready

## What Belongs Here
- Analytics dashboards
- Advanced search and filters
- Export/import functionality
- Notification systems
- Reporting tools
- UI enhancements

## Guidelines
- **Feature Flags**: Must respect feature flag settings
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works without them
- **User Value**: Must provide clear benefit
- **Performance**: Should not impact core functionality
- **Documentation**: Clear usage instructions

## Integration Pattern
```javascript
import { isEnhancementEnabled } from '../../config/featureFlags';

function MyFeature() {
  if (!isEnhancementEnabled('MY_FEATURE')) {
    return null; // or fallback UI
  }

  // Feature implementation
}
```
