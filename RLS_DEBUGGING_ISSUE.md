# RLS Implementation Debugging Issue - AI Engagement Hub

**Date:** January 22, 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL - Supabase Client Query Hanging Issue

## Current Problem Summary

We are implementing Row Level Security (RLS) on a React/Supabase application, but encountering a critical issue where **Supabase client queries hang indefinitely** even after completely disabling RLS on all tables.

## Technical Context

**Application Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 with Create React App
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL 
- Authentication: Supabase Auth (recently migrated from Firebase)
- Database Client: Supabase JavaScript client

**Database Connection Details:**
- Host: `aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543`
- Database: `postgres` 
- Connection pooler: Supabase managed pooler
- Authentication: JWT tokens (anon key for client, service key disabled)

## Specific Issue

### The Hanging Query

**Location:** `src/services/supabaseApi.js` - `courseApi.getUserCourses()` function

**Problematic Code:**
```javascript
const { data: memberships, error: membershipsError } = await dbClient
  .from('course_memberships')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .eq('status', 'approved')
  .order('joined_at', { ascending: false });
```

**Behavior:**
- Query starts executing (logs show "Querying course_memberships...")
- **Never completes** - no response, no error, no timeout
- Causes entire Dashboard to show gray loading boxes indefinitely
- Same user query works perfectly via direct PostgreSQL connection

### Direct Database Test (WORKS)

```sql
-- This query executes successfully in 50ms via psql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM course_memberships 
WHERE user_id = 'd14e1058-89e8-4c26-9d0c-0508a60e544a';
-- Returns: 0 (expected - user has no course memberships)
```

### RLS Status Confirmation (ALL DISABLED)

```sql
-- Verified: ALL tables have RLS disabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = true;
-- Returns: (0 rows)
```

## Authentication Flow Details

The user authentication is working correctly:

```
‚úÖ Supabase client initialized
‚úÖ User authenticated: d14e1058-89e8-4c26-9d0c-0508a60e544a (sage+admin@sagerock.com)  
‚úÖ User synced to public.users table
‚úÖ Auth context provides user to components
‚úÖ Dashboard component receives user data correctly
‚ùå First Supabase query hangs indefinitely
```

## Environment Configuration

**Environment Variables (Confirmed Working):**
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://qbkpxtrnseghzsrvqhih.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs... (valid JWT)
```

**Supabase Client Configuration:**
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
```

## Debugging Attempts Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Complete RLS Reset
- Disabled RLS on ALL tables: `ALTER TABLE [table] DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- Dropped all existing policies
- Granted full permissions: `GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated, anon, service_role;`

### 2. ‚úÖ Authentication Timeout Fix
- Added 5-second timeout to prevent auth hanging
- User authentication completes successfully

### 3. ‚úÖ Error Boundary Implementation
- Added React Error Boundary to catch JavaScript errors
- No errors caught - query simply hangs without throwing

### 4. ‚úÖ Detailed Logging Added
- Console logs confirm query starts but never completes
- No error messages, no network failures, no timeouts

### 5. ‚úÖ Database Direct Testing
- Direct PostgreSQL queries work perfectly
- Table exists, user permissions confirmed
- Data is accessible via psql

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Query Bypass (Current Workaround)
- Temporarily bypassed the hanging query with empty array
- Dashboard loads successfully when query is skipped
- Confirms issue is specifically with Supabase client query execution

## Current Workaround

```javascript
// TEMPORARILY BYPASSED: Skip course memberships query that's hanging
console.log('üîç courseApi.getUserCourses: BYPASSING course_memberships query for now...');
const memberships = []; // Empty array for now
const membershipsError = null;
```

This allows the app to function, but we need to resolve the underlying Supabase client issue.

## Console Logs Pattern

**Expected Flow:**
```
üîç courseApi.getUserCourses: Starting for userId: d14e1058-89e8-4c26-9d0c-0508a60e544a
üîç courseApi.getUserCourses: Querying course_memberships...
üîç courseApi.getUserCourses: Memberships result: {...}  // ‚ùå NEVER REACHES HERE
```

**Actual Flow:**
```
üîç courseApi.getUserCourses: Starting for userId: d14e1058-89e8-4c26-9d0c-0508a60e544a  
üîç courseApi.getUserCourses: Querying course_memberships...
[INFINITE HANG - no further logs]
```

## Hypotheses for Root Cause

### 1. Connection Pooler Issue
- Supabase connection pooler may have timeout/hanging connections
- Client queries hang while direct connections work

### 2. JWT Token Issue  
- Anon key JWT may have permission/claims issues
- Token might be valid but cause query execution problems

### 3. Supabase Client Library Bug
- React client library may have bug with specific query patterns
- Connection state management issue in browser

### 4. Network/Browser Issue
- Browser network stack hanging on specific requests
- CORS or preflight request issues

### 5. Database Connection State
- Supabase client connection in bad state
- Connection not properly initialized or authenticated

## Questions for Analysis

1. **Has anyone seen Supabase JavaScript client queries hang like this?**
2. **Are there known issues with connection poolers and client queries?**
3. **Could this be related to the recent Firebase ‚Üí Supabase auth migration?** 
4. **Should we try a different Supabase client configuration or initialization approach?**
5. **Are there timeout settings we should configure for Supabase queries?**
6. **Could browser dev tools Network tab show what's happening to the HTTP requests?**

## Immediate Next Steps Needed

1. **Identify why Supabase client queries hang** when direct DB queries work
2. **Resolve the hanging query issue** so we can test RLS implementation properly  
3. **Implement RLS incrementally** once basic queries work reliably

## Repository Context

**Repository:** https://github.com/sagerock/ai-musical-theater-course  
**Branch:** main  
**Key Files:**
- `src/services/supabaseApi.js` - Database API layer
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Authentication management  
- `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.js` - Where issue manifests

This is blocking our RLS implementation and app functionality. Any insights on resolving Supabase client query hanging issues would be greatly appreciated.
