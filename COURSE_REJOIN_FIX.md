# Course Re-Join Fix for Rejected Students

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED - Students Can Now Re-Request Course Enrollment

### Problem
When an instructor accidentally rejects a student's course enrollment request, the student cannot re-request to join the course. They get a "Missing or insufficient permissions" error.

### Root Cause
**Firestore Security Rules Issue**: Students could **create** new course membership requests but could not **update** existing rejected memberships back to pending status.

**Specific Error**: 
- Line 696 in `firebaseApi.js` tries to update the membership status from 'rejected' to 'pending'
- Security rule line 119 only allowed instructors and admins to update course memberships
- Students were blocked from updating their own rejected memberships

### Solution Applied
Updated **Firestore security rules** (`firestore.rules`) to allow students to update their own rejected memberships back to pending:

```javascript
// Before: Only instructors and admins could update memberships
allow update, delete: if isInstructorInCourse(resource.data.courseId) || isGlobalAdmin();

// After: Students can also update their own rejected memberships to pending
allow update, delete: if isInstructorInCourse(resource.data.courseId) || 
                         isGlobalAdmin() || 
                         (membershipId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*') &&
                          resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid &&
                          resource.data.status == 'rejected' &&
                          request.resource.data.status == 'pending');
```

### Security Constraints
The fix is **highly secure** and only allows:
- ✅ **User owns membership**: `membershipId.matches(request.auth.uid + '_.*')`
- ✅ **User ID matches**: `resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid`
- ✅ **Current status is rejected**: `resource.data.status == 'rejected'`  
- ✅ **New status is pending**: `request.resource.data.status == 'pending'`

This means students can **ONLY**:
- Update their **own** memberships
- Change status from **rejected** → **pending**
- Cannot modify any other fields or statuses

### Flow After Fix
1. **Student joins course** → Creates pending membership
2. **Instructor rejects** → Status becomes 'rejected'
3. **Student re-joins course** → Updates rejected membership back to 'pending'
4. **Instructor can approve** → Normal approval process continues
5. **Email notifications sent** → Instructors and admins are notified of re-request

### Files Modified
- **`firestore.rules`**: Updated course membership security rules
- **Status**: Deployed to Firebase and committed to GitHub

### Testing Instructions
1. **As instructor**: Reject a student's course enrollment request
2. **As student**: Try to join the same course again using the course code
3. **Expected result**: Should succeed and create new pending request
4. **Verify**: Instructor should receive email notification about re-request

## Benefits
- ✅ **Prevents accidental permanent rejections**
- ✅ **Allows instructor error correction**
- ✅ **Maintains security** - students can only update their own rejected memberships
- ✅ **Preserves audit trail** - email notifications sent for re-requests
- ✅ **No data loss** - existing membership updated rather than creating duplicates

The course re-join functionality now works correctly while maintaining proper security controls!
