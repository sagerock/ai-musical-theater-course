AI ENGAGEMENT HUB

Finally, I'd like to include our AI Engagement Hub platform, which I've developed specifically for educational AI oversight. This tool helps educators understand and guide how students interact with AI across multiple platforms (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity).

Key features for educators:
- Real-time analytics on student AI usage patterns
- Multi-model support in one secure platform
- FERPA-compliant with enterprise-grade security
- Tag-based organization for assignments
- Student reflection capabilities
- No AI training on educational data

Pricing Options:
1. Monthly Plan: $75 per class + $30 per student per month
2. Annual Plan: $50 per class + $20 per student per month (billed annually - 33% savings)

For your $4k budget, the annual plan would cover:
- 1 class for the full year: $600
- Up to 170 students for the year: $3,400
- Total: $4,000

This would give your entire class access to premium AI tools with full educational oversight and analytics throughout the academic year.

ALTERNATIVE BUDGET BREAKDOWN (if you need to fit it with other tools):

For a typical class of 25 students:
- Monthly: $825/month ($75 + 25×$30)
- Annual: $550/month when billed annually ($50 + 25×$20) = $6,600/year

Or for a smaller seminar of 10 students:
- Annual: $250/month when billed annually = $3,000/year
