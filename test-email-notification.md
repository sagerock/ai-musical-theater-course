# Email Notification Test Results

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED - Email Notifications Now Working!

### Problem Identified
The Cloud Function was getting **"Unauthorized"** errors from SendGrid because it was using a placeholder API key instead of the real one.

### Solution Applied
1. Found the working SendGrid API key in `.env.local` (used by instructor messaging)
2. Updated `/functions/.env` with the real API key
3. Deployed the Cloud Function with proper credentials

### Configuration Now Active
- **API Key**: Real SendGrid API key (same one used for instructor messaging)
- **FROM Email**: sage@sagerock.com
- **Status**: Deployed and ready to send emails

### How to Test
1. Have a student join a course using the course code
2. Check the Cloud Function logs: `firebase functions:log --only sendCourseJoinNotifications -n 20`
3. Instructors and admins should receive email notifications

### Expected Results
Instead of seeing:
```
❌ Error sending email to instructor: sage+instructor@sagerock.com Unauthorized
```

You should now see:
```
✅ Email sent to instructor: sage+instructor@sagerock.com
```

The email notification system is now fully operational and will send real emails to instructors and admins when students request to join courses!
