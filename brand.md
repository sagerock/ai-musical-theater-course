**AI Engagement Hub** is a powerful analytics platform that helps educators understand how students interact with AI in real time.  
Designed for classrooms at any level—from high school to higher ed—it provides a smarter lens on AI usage, offering teachers clear visibility into prompt activity, model selection, and engagement patterns across leading AI tools.

Rather than generating content, AI Engagement Hub empowers teachers to observe, reflect, and respond to how students are learning *with* AI.  
With rich filtering, tagging, and intuitive dashboards, it supports accountability, academic integrity, and deeper insight into the evolving relationship between students and artificial intelligence.
